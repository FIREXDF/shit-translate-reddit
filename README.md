This is a Userscript that will search if on the url on reddit got an "tl" and will remove it and it's will reload the page. I made this script because the translation in french are very bad + i disable the translation but it come back when you clicking a Reddit link on Google ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

**You need Tampermonkey or [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)** (I recomend using [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/))
